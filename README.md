Currently adopted method is the Gradient boosted decision tree.(XGBoost/LightGBM)  
This works well with tabular datasets. 
Features were orthogonal .
Anova was used over mutual gain for feature reduction.

If we need a webpage data based classfication ,we may need to use BERT.

### Dependencies: 
NLTK and BeautifulSoup.<br>
EasyList.<br>
Yslow with PhantomJS <br>
Merceine API <br> 
WebArchives API <br>



#### Thoughts/Ideas ::
1.Siamese Net (pairwise comparision, how to design triplet loss) <br>
2.Relevancy Sorting (Used by google, fine-tuned mix of a lot of stuff)<br>
3.For a security search engine specific task, and since this is credibility assessment<br>
-- Inverse Reinforcement learning. (targetted recommendations) <br>
-- BERT (Used by google for youtube searches) <br>
4. Check Zenserp api<br>
5.What should be the search bias? <br>
